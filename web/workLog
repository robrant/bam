All the django installation media is being stored in /Applications/xxPythonLibs

1. Installed Django-1.4 as per the documentation online (from within the Django directory).
   sudo python setup.py install 

2. Then installed django-leaflet-0.0.2 using pip. Inside the directory:
   pip install django-leaflet
   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-leaflet
   

3. Then installed django-mongo engine using pip (having downloaded the following directories: 
   wkornewald-django-nonrel-be48c152abc6
   wkornewald-djangotoolbox-a8cdf61ba9c0
   
   In doing so, I think this uninstalled django and then reinstalled it, so the leaflet stuff may have gone.
   
4. So tried re-installing leaflet-django to get that working. Was already installed and hopefully works.
   
5. All of this basically failed - specifically when trying to specify to use a mongo database in the
   django setting.py. So having done some reading (and lots of people saying just use pymongo) I'm doing to direct
   route. however, in setting it up, you need to have a database, so I used the sqlLite option, but won't use it.
